        Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has written to Tamil Nadu 
        Chief Minister MK Stalin urging him to take necessary action to gradually 
        release water from the Mullaperiyar dam, considering that the water level is rising.
        The first level warning was issued by Tamil Nadu on October 23. In his letter written on October 24, CM Pinarayi pointed out the recent floods and landslides in Kerala due
        to the heavy rains and asked the Tamil Nadu government to regulate the water level in 
        the dam so that untoward incidents can be avoided as the "rains are expected to intensify 
        in the coming days”.Mullaperiyar dam, which is located in Kerala’s Idukki district, 
        is managed by the Tamil Nadu government. The dam was constructed by the British in 1895 
        to meet the water requirements of Madurai in Tamil Nadu.

                The issue came to light after Tamil Nadu chief minister sent a
                letter to his Kerala counterpart, thanking him for the permission to
                cut trees near the baby dam in Mullaperiyar reservoir.The Kerala government 
                has revoked the controversial order permitting 
                <i>Tamil Nadu to cut 15 trees to strengthen the baby dam in Mullaperiyar</i>, 
                said state forest minister AK Saseendran on Sunday adding that permission
                 was granted by mistake and action will be taken against officials concerned.
